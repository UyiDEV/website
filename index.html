                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name Omoruyi Emmanuel Osakue, ALT ID <strong>ALT/SOE/204/0172</strong>. I am a graduate of the University of Benin, where I studied Mechanical Engineering specifically Metallury and Material
                engineering. I am the first of four sibings and an indigin of Benin City,
                Edo State. I have loved machines and computers since I was a child. I longed to understand how they functioned, and more importantly, how I could make them work for me. 
                This curiosity fueled countless hours spent dismantling old electronics, tinkering with software, and teaching myself basic coding languages. 
                While there were occasional setbacks at the time, it only strengthened my resolve. so naturally, over time I gravitated towards software engineering 
                I am currently enrolled as a student at AltSchool Africa Software Engineering Karatu 2024, Cloud Engineering track.
                During Material Science studies, I independently pursued online courses and certifications in software engineering. 
                I thought about game design but soon discovered I much rather play games than develop them so I tried frontend engineering and then backend engineering 
                but none compared to the intricate dance of virtual machines, and networks, and the limitless scalability offered by the cloud captivated me. 
                I discovered a field where my love for problem-solving, my drive for self-improvement, and my desire to create a meaningful impact could converge.</p>
		<p>In this project we were asked to envision ourselves as part of a startup team tasked with creating a prototype for a web application. The first step would be to provision a server and set up a simple landing page to demonstrate our teamâ€™s capabilities to potential investors. Basically provisioning a Linux Server with a simple HTML page</p>
